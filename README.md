# Sentiment Analysis with Natural Language Processing

Fourth project for Udacity's Front-end Nanodegree.

The app fetches the sentiment analysis of either text or a webpage provided by the user.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have a browser, Chrome is preferable.
- You have installed node and have a code editor such as Visual Studio Code.

As this project depends on Nodejs and Node Package Manager (NPM) you must download and install Node (NPM comes with Node) from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

## Installation

### Installing project dependencies

After cloning, open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install
```

> _tip_: **npm i** is shorthand for **npm install**

## API setup

In order to run the app locally you need to signup for the meaningCloud API [here](https://www.meaningcloud.com/developer/sentiment-analysis).

In the root directory, create a .env file to safely store your API key.

```
API_KEY = "**************************"
```
